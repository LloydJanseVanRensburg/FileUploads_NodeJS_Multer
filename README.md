# FileUploads_NodeJS_Multer
In this project i went through the basics of handling file uploads to the server in Node.js using Multer

This repo has the following code:
* Backend code this includes the server side rendered frontend aswell as all the backend API code used to handle the file uploads
* Clientside code this includes the client side rendered frontend (React App) 

To use or test this repo code you would need to do the following:
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Navigate into backend folder and run npm install
3. Navigate into the frontend folder and run npm install
4. Then you can start the backend by nagivating into the backend folder and running node server.js
5. Last step is to navigate into the frontend folder and run npm start then you should be all set...
